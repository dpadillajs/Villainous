# Villianous

Villianous is a front-end application where users must not press the same picture
more than once or risk restarting their score back to 0. Memory is the name of the game because
each point gained shuffles the order in which the pictures appear.

### Skills Learned

I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife
who is also a very talented programmer and Stack Overflow. Here are some things
I learned on the fly:

- React (Popular JS Framework)
- Material-UI (Popular React Framework)

### Comments

This application was built using React that I had learned indepedently on Udemy over the course of a
week. I am very proud of this project because I utilized many features of React such as functional components,
state components, lifecycles, ES6, etc.
